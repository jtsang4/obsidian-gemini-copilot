## Overview

### What are IDE-Style Completions?

Completions provide:
- Real-time text suggestions as you type

- Single-keypress acceptance (Tab)
- Seamless integration with your writing flow

### Benefits

1. **Faster Writing**: Complete sentences and paragraphs quickly
2. **Consistency**: Maintain style and terminology
3. **Idea Generation**: Get suggestions for what to write next
4. **Reduced Typing**: Especially helpful for repetitive content
5. **Learning Tool**: See how AI would continue your thoughts

## Getting Started

### Enable Completions

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`)
2. Search for "Gemini Scribe: Toggle Completions"
3. Press Enter
4. See confirmation notice: "Completions enabled" or "Completions disabled"

### Quick Test

1. Open any markdown note
2. Type a few words and pause
3. After ~750ms, a gray suggestion appears
4. Press `Tab` to accept or any other key to dismiss

## How Completions Work

### The Completion Process

1. **You type** in your note
2. **Pause detected** (750ms without typing)
3. **Context gathered** from surrounding text
4. **AI generates** a suggestion
5. **Suggestion appears** in gray text
6. **You choose** to accept or continue typing

### Context Understanding

The AI considers:
- Previous paragraphs
- Current sentence
- Document structure
- Markdown formatting
- Your writing style

### Smart Predictions

Completions understand:
- **Lists**: Continues numbered or bulleted lists
- **Headers**: Suggests appropriate content
- **Code blocks**: Language-aware suggestions
- **Links**: Completes wiki-links and markdown links
- **Tables**: Helps with table formatting

## Using Completions

### Basic Usage

1. **Start typing** normally
2. **Pause briefly** when you want a suggestion
3. **Review suggestion** (appears in gray)
4. **Accept or dismiss**:
   - `Tab`: Accept the suggestion
   - Any other key: Dismiss and continue

### Accepting Completions

**Full acceptance**: Press `Tab` once
- Entire suggestion is inserted
- Cursor moves to end
- Continue typing normally

**Dismissing**: Press any other key
- Suggestion disappears
- Your keypress is processed normally
- No text is inserted

### When Completions Appear

Suggestions trigger when:
- You pause mid-sentence
- After punctuation (. ! ?)
- At the start of new lines
- After list markers (-, *, 1.)
- Inside markdown structures

## Configuration

### Performance Tuning

Completions are optimized for:
- 750ms debounce (prevents excessive API calls)

- Completions work alongside templates
- May suggest template syntax
- Edit suggestions as needed

## Best Practices

### 1. Context is Key

Write clear beginnings:
- ❌ "The thing is"
- ✅ "The main challenge with this approach is"

### 2. Pause Strategically

Pause when you:
- Need the next idea
- Want formatting help
- Seek specific information
- Feel stuck

### 3. Edit and Refine

Completions are suggestions:
- Review before accepting
- Edit after accepting
- Don't accept blindly
- Maintain your voice

### 4. Use for First Drafts

Completions excel at:
- Getting ideas flowing
- Overcoming blank pages
- Rapid prototyping
- Rough drafts

### 5. Disable When Needed

Turn off for:
- Final editing
- Precise writing
- Personal journaling
- Sensitive content

## Common Patterns

### Email Templates
```
"Thank you for" → "your email regarding..."
"I hope this" → "message finds you well"
"Please let me know" → "if you have any questions"
```

### Technical Documentation
```
"To configure" → "the settings, follow these steps:"
"The API returns" → "a JSON response containing..."
"Error handling" → "is implemented using try-catch blocks"
```

### Academic Writing
```
"This research" → "contributes to the existing literature by..."
"The findings suggest" → "a strong correlation between..."
"Further investigation" → "is needed to determine..."
```

### Note Organization
```
"## Summary" → [AI provides section structure]
"### Key Points" → [AI suggests bullet points]
"Related:" → "[[Note 1]], [[Note 2]]"
```
